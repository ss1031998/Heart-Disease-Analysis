# Heart-Disease-Analysis
🫀 Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI to visualize survival trends, age patterns, and risk factors like diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking. It helps identify high-risk age groups and clinical indicators impacting patient survival.


# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard | Power BI Project

This project analyzes clinical heart disease data using Power BI to identify survival trends, health risks, and condition impacts based on age, gender, and comorbidities.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 📈 **Survival Rate**: 68.04%
- 👵 **Avg Age of Survival**: 58.83 years
- 💊 Conditions Tracked: Diabetes, Anaemia, High Blood Pressure, Smoking
- 📊 Visualized with: Power BI interactive dashboard

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: Clinical heart disease data (CSV format)
- **Fields**:
  - Age, Gender, Death Event
  - Serum Creatinine, Ejection Fraction
  - Diabetes, Anaemia, High Blood Pressure, Smoking

---

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Females aged 51–60 show the highest survival rate (83.33%)**
2. **Higher serum creatinine levels correlate with lower survival**
3. **Comorbidities like high BP and diabetes increase death risk**
4. **Below 40 age group has lowest survival rate (40%)**
